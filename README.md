1. How I Approach Designing Software
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The project strengthened my component-based design skills by requiring me to break down complex visual elements into manageable geometric primitives with distinct material properties.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an incremental implementation process with continuous visual validation to identify and address rendering issues immediately.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The modular approach to separating geometry, materials, and lighting concerns can be applied to any complex software system that requires clear separation of responsibilities.
2. How I Approach Developing Programs
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I employed parameter tuning and data-driven development to create flexible material and lighting systems that could be easily adjusted for optimal visual results.
How did iteration factor into your development?
Each visualization provided immediate feedback that informed subsequent adjustments to lighting parameters, object positioning, and material properties.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?
I progressed from building basic scene elements to implementing sophisticated lighting systems, developing better debugging techniques and system integration skills along the way.
3. How Computer Science Helps in Reaching Your Goals
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills for your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics provide practical applications of advanced mathematics and physics concepts that strengthen interdisciplinary connections in my education.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills for your future professional pathway?
The skills I've gained in implementing 3D graphics and lighting are directly transferable to fields like game development, data visualization, simulation, and AR/VR applications.
